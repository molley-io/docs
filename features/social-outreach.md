# Social Outreach

## The Problem

You've built something great. Now you need to tell the world.

But launching across multiple platforms is chaos. Product Hunt has its own rules. LinkedIn wants professional storytelling. Twitter demands brevity. Reddit hates self-promotion. Each platform is a different game with different players.

Most founders either:
- **Spray and pray** — Post the same message everywhere and wonder why it falls flat
- **Pick one platform** — Miss audiences on channels where they could have won
- **Burn out** — Try to do everything manually and run out of steam before launch day

The result? Launches that fizzle. Content that doesn't resonate. Opportunities lost because you couldn't be everywhere at once with the right message.

## The Solution

Social Outreach treats your launch as a **coordinated campaign**, not a collection of random posts.

Instead of thinking "I need to post on LinkedIn," you think "I'm telling a story across platforms, and each platform plays a specific role in that story."

## How It Works

### Communication Arcs

An **Arc** is your campaign's narrative structure. It answers: *What story are we telling, and how does it unfold over time?*

Every successful launch follows a pattern:
1. **Build anticipation** — Tease what's coming
2. **Launch with impact** — Maximize day-one visibility
3. **Sustain momentum** — Keep the conversation going
4. **Convert interest** — Turn attention into action

Social Outreach makes this structure explicit. You define your arc's objective, break it into phases, and the AI helps you execute each phase across every relevant platform.

### Platform Intelligence

Each platform has a different content model:

| Platform | What Works | Why It Matters |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Product Hunt** | Single, polished launch submission | You get one shot. The tagline, description, and first comment must be perfect. |
| **LinkedIn** | Multi-post storytelling series | Professional audiences want the journey, not just the announcement. |
| **Twitter/X** | Punchy threads | Real-time updates and social proof build momentum. |
| **Reddit** | Authentic discussion | Communities smell marketing from miles away. Value first, product second. |
| **Hacker News** | Technical depth | Show your work. Explain the interesting problems you solved. |

The AI understands these differences. When you generate content for Product Hunt, it creates a launch-day submission with Q&A prep. For LinkedIn, it creates a week-long series building narrative tension. For Reddit, it crafts a discussion post that leads with value.

### The Content Calendar

All your content lives in one calendar. You see what's going out, when, and on which platform. No more spreadsheets. No more "wait, did we post that already?"

The calendar view shows your entire launch at a glance. The list view lets you drill into details. Export to CSV when you need to hand off to scheduling tools.

## Why This Matters

### For Product Launches

A Product Hunt launch isn't just about Product Hunt. The best launches coordinate:
- **Pre-launch**: LinkedIn posts building anticipation, Twitter teasers, community engagement
- **Launch day**: Product Hunt submission, Twitter thread, LinkedIn announcement
- **Post-launch**: Reddit discussions, Hacker News submission, follow-up content

Social Outreach lets you plan all of this in one place, with AI that understands what each platform needs.

### For Ongoing Marketing

Not every arc is a launch. You might run:
- **Thought leadership campaigns** — Establish expertise across platforms
- **Feature announcements** — Coordinate updates across channels
- **Community building** — Systematic engagement across communities

The arc structure works for any coordinated effort.

### For Teams

When multiple people are involved in marketing, coordination becomes critical. Social Outreach provides:
- **Shared visibility** — Everyone sees the plan
- **Content approval** — Review before publishing
- **Phase tracking** — Know where you are in the campaign

## The AI Advantage

### Content That Fits

The AI doesn't just write content — it writes content that fits each platform's culture and constraints.

Ask it to generate LinkedIn content and you get professional storytelling with hooks and calls to action. Ask for Reddit content and you get authentic, value-first discussion starters. Ask for Product Hunt and you get a polished submission with anticipated Q&A.

### Strategy That Makes Sense

The AI knows your product, your audience, and your goals. When it suggests phases, it's not generic advice — it's tailored to what you're actually trying to accomplish.

When it recommends channels, it considers where your audience actually spends time, not just where everyone else posts.

### Speed Without Sacrifice

Generating platform-appropriate content for a multi-channel launch used to take days. Now it takes minutes. You still review and refine, but you start with something good instead of a blank page.

## The Bigger Picture

## What Success Looks Like

- Your launches feel coordinated, not chaotic
