# Marketing Plans

## The Problem

Strategy without documentation is just vibes.

You know what you're trying to do. Your co-founder knows. Maybe your head of marketing knows. But when someone asks "what's our go-to-market strategy?" — can anyone point to a document?

Most early-stage teams operate on implicit strategy. The plan lives in conversations, Slack threads, and people's heads. This works until:

- **Someone new joins** and has to piece together the strategy from context clues
- **Priorities conflict** and there's no source of truth to resolve them
- **Time passes** and you forget why you made certain decisions
- **Execution drifts** because no one remembers what the plan actually was

The result? Teams that feel aligned but aren't. Effort that doesn't compound. Strategy that exists in theory but not in practice.

## The Solution

Marketing Plans is where strategy becomes explicit.

Not a 50-page document no one reads. Not a slide deck that gets outdated. A living document that captures what you're trying to do, why, and how — in enough detail to actually guide decisions.

## How It Works

### Strategy as a Document

A marketing plan answers the fundamental questions:

- **What are we trying to achieve?** — Specific, measurable objectives
- **Who are we trying to reach?** — Target audience with real detail
- **What's our message?** — Positioning and value proposition
- **How will we reach them?** — Channels and tactics
- **How will we know it's working?** — Success metrics

When these answers are written down, everyone can reference them. Decisions become easier because you have criteria to evaluate against.

### Living Documents

Marketing plans aren't set-and-forget. They evolve as you learn.

The rich editor lets you update plans as reality changes. Add notes about what's working. Revise tactics that aren't. Keep the document current so it remains useful.

### AI-Assisted Planning

Starting from a blank page is hard. The AI helps you:

- **Draft initial plans** based on your product and goals
- **Identify gaps** in existing plans
- **Suggest tactics** you might not have considered
- **Refine messaging** to be clearer and more compelling

The AI knows your product, your audience, and your competitive context. Its suggestions are specific to your situation, not generic marketing advice.

## Why This Matters

### Alignment Requires Artifacts

You can't align on something that doesn't exist. When strategy is implicit, everyone has their own interpretation. They're all slightly different. No one realizes it until there's a conflict.

Written plans create shared understanding. Not because writing is magic, but because the act of writing forces clarity. Vague ideas become specific commitments.

### Strategy Guides Tactics

Without a plan, every tactic is evaluated in isolation. "Should we do a webinar?" becomes a debate about webinars in general, not whether this webinar supports your strategy.

With a plan, the question becomes: "Does this webinar help us achieve our objectives with our target audience?" The plan provides the framework for decision-making.

### Learning Requires Memory

If you don't document what you planned, you can't evaluate whether it worked. You can't distinguish between "the strategy was wrong" and "we didn't execute the strategy."

Plans create accountability. Not in a punitive sense, but in a learning sense. You can look back and understand what you were trying to do, what actually happened, and what to do differently.

## The AI Advantage

### Plans That Make Sense

Generic marketing plan templates are useless. "Define your target audience" — thanks, very helpful.

Molley helps you create plans that are specific to your situation. It knows your product, your market, your constraints. When it suggests a go-to-market approach, it's tailored to what you're actually selling and who you're actually selling to.

### Gap Analysis

It's hard to see what's missing from your own plan. You're too close to it.

The AI can review your plan and identify gaps:
- "You haven't defined success metrics for this channel"
- "Your messaging doesn't address this common objection"
- "This timeline is aggressive given your resources"

Fresh eyes, even artificial ones, catch things you miss.

### Rapid Iteration

Rewriting a marketing plan is tedious. The AI makes iteration fast.

- "Adjust this plan for a different market segment"
- "Expand the tactics section with more detail"
- "Simplify this for a board presentation"

You can explore different approaches without starting from scratch each time.

## The Bigger Picture

Marketing Plans sits at the top of the execution hierarchy:

1. **Marketing Plans** — Define strategy and objectives
2. **Outreach Ideas** — Generate tactical concepts
3. **Social Outreach** — Plan and schedule campaigns
4. **Outreach Tools** — Enable consistent execution
5. **CRM** — Track results and relationships

Strategy flows down. Results flow up. The plan is what connects them.

## What Success Looks Like

When Marketing Plans is working:
- New team members can understand your strategy by reading a document
- Tactical decisions reference the plan, not just intuition
- You can explain why you're doing what you're doing
- Strategy evolves based on evidence, not just opinions
- The gap between what you planned and what you did is visible

The goal isn't to create bureaucracy. It's to make your thinking explicit so it can be shared, evaluated, and improved.
