# CRM

## The Problem

Relationships don't live in spreadsheets. But that's where most early-stage teams try to manage them.

You meet someone at a conference. You have a great conversation. You exchange cards. Then what? Their info goes into a spreadsheet, a note, or worse — nowhere. Six months later, you can't remember who they were, what you talked about, or why they mattered.

The problem compounds as you grow:
- **Contacts multiply** — You're meeting more people than you can track mentally
- **Context gets lost** — Who introduced you? What did you discuss? What's their situation?
- **Follow-ups fall through** — You meant to reach out, but life happened
- **Relationships go cold** — People who were warm become strangers because you didn't stay in touch

Enterprise CRMs solve this, but they're built for sales teams with dedicated ops people. They're overkill for a startup founder who just needs to remember who they've talked to and what to do next.

## The Solution

Molley's CRM is relationship management for people who don't have time for relationship management.

It's not about pipeline stages and forecasting. It's about keeping track of the humans you're building relationships with — and making sure good conversations lead to good outcomes.

## How It Works

### Companies and Contacts

The basic structure is simple:

**Companies** are organizations you care about — prospects, customers, partners, investors. Each company has context: what they do, why they matter, what your relationship is.

**Contacts** are people within those companies. The humans you actually talk to. Each contact has their own context: their role, your history with them, what they care about.

This hierarchy matters because business relationships are rarely one-to-one. You might know three people at a company. Understanding the company context helps you understand each relationship.

### Opportunities

When a relationship has potential to become something specific — a deal, a partnership, an investment — it becomes an **Opportunity**.

Opportunities track:
- What's the potential outcome?
- What stage is it at?
- What needs to happen next?

Not every relationship needs an opportunity. But when something is in motion, you want to track it explicitly.

### The Full Picture

When you open a company or contact, you see everything:
- Your history with them
- Notes from conversations
- Related opportunities
- Connected campaigns

No more "wait, have we talked to them before?" moments. The context is there when you need it.

## Why This Matters

### Memory at Scale

You can keep track of 20 relationships in your head. Maybe 50 if you're good. But at some point, you need external memory.

The CRM is that memory. It remembers what you've forgotten. It surfaces context when you need it. It makes sure good relationships don't die from neglect.

### Follow-Through Creates Trust

The difference between "we should grab coffee sometime" and actually grabbing coffee is follow-through. Most people don't follow through. When you do, you stand out.

The CRM makes follow-through easier. You can see who you need to reach out to. You can set reminders. You can track what you promised and whether you delivered.

### Relationships Compound

A contact you met two years ago might become your biggest customer. A casual conversation might lead to your next hire. Relationships have long time horizons.

The CRM helps you play the long game. You're not just tracking active deals — you're maintaining a network that pays dividends over years.

## The AI Advantage

### Context When You Need It

Before a meeting, ask Molley: "What do I know about this person?" Get a summary of your history, their company, relevant notes.

Before outreach, ask: "Who should I reach out to about X?" Get suggestions based on your network and their relevance.

The AI makes your CRM data useful, not just stored.

### Relationship Intelligence

The AI can identify patterns you might miss:
- "You haven't talked to these warm contacts in 3 months"
- "These companies match your ideal customer profile"
- "This contact changed jobs — might be worth reaching out"

It's like having a relationship manager who's always paying attention.

## The Bigger Picture

The CRM connects to everything else:

- **Outreach campaigns** target contacts in your CRM
- **Social Outreach** drives initial engagement; CRM tracks who responds
- **Feedback** from customers links back to their CRM records

It's not a standalone database. It's the relationship layer that ties your growth efforts together.

## What Success Looks Like

When the CRM is working:
- You never forget who someone is or why they matter
- Follow-ups happen because you have a system, not just good intentions
- Relationships stay warm because you stay in touch
- Your network becomes an asset, not just a contact list
- Context is always available when you need it

The goal isn't to turn relationships into data. It's to make sure the relationships you're building don't get lost in the chaos of building a company.
